# ~~My-First-Blog~~

Intially started this project to create a personal blog post using Django backend,
but new ideas takes me in differet direction :P

# Just register anonymously and write openly :) 

The final idea was to cretae a page for those who hesitate in speaking publicly or a little shy type of people,they can share
thoughts by posting on the page, they just have to register with random username (no email, no name, nothing just random username
and random password) and :tada: everyone can see there thoughts.
